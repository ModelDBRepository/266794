This code is provided as support material for the study:

A computational study on the regulation of synaptic plasticity and synaptic information processing in neuron-astrocyte networks.

The code has been written by R. Vuillaume, based on M. Stimberg study: Modeling neuron-glia interactions with the Brian 2 simulator (https://doi.org/10.1101/198366)

The code takes several arguments:

-a 0 (fixed)
-b x (with x between 0 and 10, it fixes the switching frequency of the input signal)
-c y (with any integer, it fixes the random seed for reproducibility across condition)
